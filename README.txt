Beneath The Seas Above
Developed by Dominic Fanaris, Gavin Conception, and Sky Crockett

As a newly promoted Senior Researcher of Extraterrestial Marine Biology, your first assignment
is to manage a research study beneath the unexplored waters of World-357.

When you open your visual interface, you will notice two tabs on the top and right side of your
screen. These will open two menus, indicated as "AREAS OF STUDY" and "LIFEFORMS". Areas of study
are where you will fuel your research using the biomass you collect from lifeforms. These
benchmarks progress from left to right, and will also unlock new lifeforms for you to introduce
to the environment. We have supplied you a small amount of biomass to kickstart your research, so
you can purchase the first benchmark and unlock your first lifeform right away.

The lifeforms menu is where you will artificially manufacture and place lifeforms into the
environment. If you have unlocked the lifeform through a benchmark and have enough biomass to
purchase one, left-clicking the lifeform's image will display a selection grid, which will
determine the location to place. Use left-click again to confirm the purchase and place the 
lifeform, or right-click to cancel. Lifeforms will naturally gather biomass over time, which can 
be extracted by clicking the syringe above them.

Progress through the benchmarks and submit a report to complete your research. As an artesan of
science and explorer of the seas above, the Coalition is counting on you!
